Code Sync Issue in VS Code and GitHub
I hope this message finds you well. My name is Zekun Liu, (SID:520400162) and I am writing to seek your assistance with a critical issue I am facing in synchronizing my code between VS Code and GitHub. I have been working on a project using VS Code and made significant changes to the code. To ensure proper version control, I followed the usual Git workflow by executing the command "git add .", "git commit -m 'finish all the work'", and finally "git push". However, upon checking the code on GitHub, I discovered that only the last 100 lines of code were updated. In an attempt to resolve this issue, I also tried making direct code modifications on GitHub, but unfortunately, no changes were reflected in the repository. I am now at a loss as to how to proceed further to ensure that all my code changes are properly synchronized between VS Code and GitHub. In order to submit this assignment, I have directly put the whole code on GitHub, and I have another repository that recorded the commit when I do this assignment. Thank you very much for your attention to this matter, and I look forward to your prompt assistance.
